## About

This app was built using create-react-app.
A live version *should* be available at https://warm-tundra-50611-d743924b6b41.herokuapp.com/

## Reflections 

I've used create-react-app (and thus, React) for this project, because I'm already familiar with it.  I also used an external carousel, as I didn't think that reinventing the wheel was the best use of time. 

React wasn't quite as helpful as a I was envisioning initially, and was actually a little distracting; most of the behavior that I wanted, I could get through css.  I went back and forth several times on how the grid should function, and eventually settled on nesting them because it felt more flexible.  Another main focus was trying to ensure a good experience on smaller screens, which led to some elements of the original design going by the wayside at lower resolutions.

I enjoyed putting together the animations.  There was a lot more that I could have done (e.g. I was envisioning a fade in from black when the page loads, which wouldn't have been hard), but I scrapped a bunch of stuff because it felt distracting on what is a fairly simple page.
